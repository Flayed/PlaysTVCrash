# PlaysTVCrash

## UPDATE 
## This was fixed by the Plays.TV team in version 1.14.1 (2016-09-29)

---

This project will crash in 2 minutes if you have version 1.14.0 of Plays.tv installed on your machine.

I believe the problem exists when there is a constant animation set up.  This might cause a graphics .dll to be loaded, which the Plays.TV client detects and attempts to attach to for recording purposes.

*NOTE* that this did not happen in previous versions of the Plays.tv client.
